# YAMKC 3DS - Yet Another Mario Kart Clone 3DS
## Description
YAMKC 3DS is a Mario Kart game clone for the 3DS. This project was made for a videogame console game development course, where our team had to do a homebrew game for the Nintendo 3DS.

This game was made with the intention to mimic the feeling of a Mario Kart game, using Mario Kart 7 as the inspiration. Due to limited time to accomplish this (about 3 months), we had to focus on the basic behaviour and ended up implementing some sort of time trials mode.

Feel free to use the code and ideas in this repository for your own games! (Check the [License](LICENSE.md) for full terms.)

You can check the following [Youtube Video](https://youtu.be/bqOL-XtQ2Nk) showcasing the v0.2 version of the game.

This project is a continuation of the Windows OpenGL game [Yet Another Mario Kart Clone](https://github.com/mariohackandglitch/YAMKC).
